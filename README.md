# CactBot

A simple DiscordBot that has several commands and does several things with wrappers. The primary goal is to help trivialize various aspects of raiding that is hard to keep track of by automating raids. It will interface with a Google Sheet to gather available times and present them into the discord client as well as manage loot aspects.

##Getting Started
Simply clone and use your own Discord bot token and Google Drive token and run.

###Prerequisites

```
discord.py
oauth2client
gspread
Python 3.4 to 3.6
```

To install
```
pep3 install discord
pep3 install oauth2client
pep3 install gspread

```

###Versioning
I use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.

###Basic Commands
```
!help will display all of the available commands
!drops or loot will display various aspects depending on params
!time will display raid times for everyone
!timeedit will edit the times people are available
!joke will tell a funny raid joke
```
This readme will be updated as the bot is updated.
